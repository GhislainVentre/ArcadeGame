# Arcade Game

Arcade Game is an end of year project of system programming. 
It aims to use the SDL2 libraries and the networking properties available with the C language.

We started by exploring the possibilities of the SDL library by making small games. 

Then in a second time to test the networking features we implemented a client and a server.
